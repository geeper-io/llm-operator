## Getting Started

### 1. **Choose Your Advanced Features**

Start with the features that align with your current needs:

- **Basic Monitoring**: Enable Langfuse for essential observability
- **Custom Workflows**: Add pipelines for specific business logic
- **Production Ready**: Combine both for enterprise deployments

### 2. **Plan Your Configuration**

Consider these factors when planning:

- **Resource Requirements**: Pipelines and monitoring add resource overhead
- **Network Access**: Ensure connectivity to external services
- **Storage Needs**: Plan for persistent data and monitoring logs
- **Security**: Implement proper access controls and secrets management

### 3. **Start Small, Scale Up**

- Begin with basic monitoring
- Add pipelines incrementally
- Monitor performance impact
- Scale based on usage patterns

## Configuration Examples

### **Basic Monitoring Setup**

```yaml
apiVersion: llm.geeper.io/v1alpha1
kind: LMDeployment
metadata:
  name: monitored-ai-app
spec:
  openwebui:
    enabled: true
    
    # Enable Langfuse monitoring
    langfuse:
      enabled: true
      url: "https://cloud.langfuse.com"
      publicKey: "your-public-key"
      secretKey: "your-secret-key"
      projectName: "my-ai-project"
      environment: "production"
```

### **Advanced Pipeline Setup**

```yaml
apiVersion: llm.geeper.io/v1alpha1
kind: LMDeployment
metadata:
  name: advanced-ai-app
spec:
  openwebui:
    enabled: true
    
    # Enable pipelines
    pipelines:
      enabled: true
      image: ghcr.io/open-webui/pipelines:main
      replicas: 2
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        size: "50Gi"
    
    # Enable monitoring
    langfuse:
      enabled: true
      # ... Langfuse config
```

### **Production-Ready Configuration**

```yaml
apiVersion: llm.geeper.io/v1alpha1
kind: LMDeployment
metadata:
  name: production-ai-app
spec:
  openwebui:
    enabled: true
    replicas: 3
    
    # Comprehensive monitoring
    langfuse:
      enabled: true
      # ... Langfuse config
    
    # Advanced pipelines
    pipelines:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 2
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        size: "100Gi"
    
    # Redis for scalability
    redis:
      enabled: true
      replicas: 3
      persistence:
        enabled: true
        size: "50Gi"
```

## Best Practices

### **Performance Optimization**

- **Resource Planning**: Allocate appropriate CPU and memory for pipelines
- **Scaling Strategy**: Start with minimal replicas and scale based on usage
- **Storage Optimization**: Use appropriate storage classes for your workload
- **Network Efficiency**: Minimize external API calls and optimize data transfer

### **Security Considerations**

- **Secret Management**: Use Kubernetes secrets for sensitive configuration
- **Network Policies**: Restrict access to pipeline and monitoring endpoints
- **RBAC**: Implement proper role-based access control
- **Audit Logging**: Track access to advanced features and monitoring data

### **Monitoring and Maintenance**

- **Health Checks**: Monitor the health of pipeline and monitoring services
- **Log Management**: Implement proper log aggregation and analysis
- **Backup Strategies**: Plan for data backup and disaster recovery
- **Update Procedures**: Establish processes for updating pipelines and monitoring

## Troubleshooting

### **Common Issues**

1. **Pipeline Deployment Failures**
   - Check resource allocation and limits
   - Verify image pull permissions
   - Review pipeline configuration and URLs

2. **Monitoring Integration Issues**
   - Verify API keys and connectivity
   - Check environment variable configuration
   - Review network policies and firewall rules
